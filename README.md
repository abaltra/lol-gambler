# The URFracle

HELLO AND WELCOME TO THE URFRACLE!
Our great lord URF has blessed us with a bunch of Ultra Rapid Fire mode games, and his desire is to test your knowledge of this most perfect game mode!

Do you know what will happen? Can you look into the void and predict the results of URF matches?

Care to put your RitoCoins where your mouth is?

If so, step right ahead. Show the world what you are made of!

Make Urf proud!

This is the whole codebase for www.urfracle.com, from the NodeJS backend to the frontend using jQuery + Jade Templating and the scripts used to query the RioT API to obtain the URF matches data.

Most of the API usage can be seen in the scripts folder, as those scripts were left running to retrieve the URF data to use later in the app.
